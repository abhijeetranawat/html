<h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>



<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </p>

  <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
  <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. </p>
